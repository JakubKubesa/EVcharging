EVcharging
-  This is my demo project to show my knowledge of Java (backend) and JavaScript (frontend).
-  EVcharging is a system for reserving electric car chargers. 
-  The admin has the ability to add parking spaces with a charging station and manage users.
-  The user has the option to add a car, create a reservation for it, and then manage the reservation.
-  The system automatically calculates how long it will take to charge the car based on the speed of the station and the size of the car's battery, and adds an extra 5 minutes for departure.


Things needed to start a project
-  installing Intellij, VS code, Postgre, Node.js
-  run command git clone
-  in SQL Shell (psql) run command: CREATE DATABASE evcharging
-  in terminal run command: "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\bin\pg_restore.exe" -U postgres -d evcharging -c "C:\path\to\project\and\file\database.dump"
-  run frontend in VScode (npm start) and run backend in Intellij (if the program crashes then pom.xml -> Maven -> Sync Project)
-  Congratulations on launching my project!
